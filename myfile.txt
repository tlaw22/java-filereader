Scala is a separate language from Java, not a framework. Scala is a general-purpose programming language that combines both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can interoperate with Java code, but it also has some features that make it different from Java, such as type inference, operator overloading, lazy evaluation, and multiple inheritance^1^]https://www.snowflake.com/guides/scala-vs-java. Scala is designed to be scalable and concise, and it is often used for building big data systems and web applications
